There is a town in Germany called Vauban that make you pay $40,000 with your house if you want to have a parking space. Also in this town there are only two places to park and this means that 70% of the population there down own cars and 57% sold their cars to live there. People in this town say that living there with no cars relieves stress.

In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.

On mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. Their were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more then three people but they make plubic transit free from Monday to Friday.

These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they celebrate their third year where cars have been banned with the onmly motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day ""The day without cars"" in the capital city which has about 7million poeple. They are doing this to pormote other mean of transportation and violators adn fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.

In the quote, Carlos describes how stress is relieved by lower pollution and opening yourself up to activities that you and someone you love could enjoy while getting to work. Stress can be driven by simple things in life such as trying to find a parking spot to access the market. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6).

BFC4CADADD49,150,3055,"Vauban is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"". Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipes.. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

In the United States, the Envirornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislatores are starting to act, if cautiously. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog... Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Westen Europe. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer licenses as each year goes by. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envirornment, since transportation is the second largest souce of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond product range beyond the personal vehicle. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..

New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...

For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts.

Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.

The students were only exposed to the content in Algebra 1, therefore making it more productive if the math teacher designed the summer project. By implementing content of the next school year into the summer project, students will be better prepared for the class. Because teachers teach the curriculum for the students, they know what is most important/useful to remember. For instance, a Biology 1 teacher knows that the unit focused on animal and plant cell anatomy is crucial to remember because it is always used in Biology in general, so she mostly focuses the project with cell anatomy. It is beneficial to students if they are informed what is expected to be to know in the future. Teachers who know what is most useful to know would design summer projects more effectively by knowing what content to emphasize. Students do not know what is important to learn because they are in the process of learning, so having them design summer projects would not effectively help them better prepare over the summer.

Allowing them to pick it will mostlikly make them make better choices much rather then carless ones . ,Rebuttal,489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609
E05ACF2DFCB8,3278,4144,The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer. ,Concluding Statement,610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772

844406CFDCD9,1022,2014,One of the ways you can tell is by seeing if they even started or finished because if they at least started the prodject at least you know that they thought about it or was planning on finnishing it and over time just forgot about it and if you was to finish it it will show the teacher that you're resonsible enough to do that at least. Another way to tell is to see if they remember befor they go on break like you should tell them at least once before class starts and once after class that way it sticks in their head and they don't foget about it before break starts. Not only will this prepare them for the future but it will also teach them how important responsibility is. Responsibility is a huge thing this word means more to some then to others and that's beacause most people look at how responsible you are on your own before they can let you branch out to others. It's honestly just one of those things if you show good responsibility life will become easier as time flies past.,Evidence,200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388
844406CFDCD9,2035,2948, allowing students to think of their own prodjects would be a good idea is because it allows you to see exactly how creative they can be if they used their own thoughts and imagination. Because yeah teachers can think of something quick and easy for you to do for the prodject but that doesn't show how creative that student really can be. You never know what type of fun things they can put together for the prodject they could always think of something the teacher would have never thought about and really blow them out of the park with how good they did. This just shows them how responsible you are or can be when you're willing to do the work. Yes I know most kids don't want to be working on a prodject during the summer but if they was to just work and get the prodject over with that will give them the rest of the summer and they won't have to worry about finifhing up that prodject durign their break. ,Counterclaim,392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564
844406CFDCD9,2949,3730,Now back to what I believe schools should do. And that is I believe schools should have the teachers come up with the prodject ideas. The main reason for that is because I am one of those kids that will put something such as a prodject to the edge and just forget about it until school is about to start back up and then I'll remember and try my best to get it done before the first day of school. Yes I know I shouldn't do that and I should just do it to get it over with but that's just not how I work. I am the type like most others who don't want to do anything while im on break especially if we are on summer break because that's the time in my head that I have to myself.

Plus I feel like it would actually mtivate the students to do the work since they only have to do a bit of research and do the prodject. The way taht I see it is Summer is meant for us to have fun and enjoy ourselves with no school but to add a prodject to do during the break almost feels like our summer is being taken away a bit. Most people such as myself won't do the work or they will but they will wait until it's literaly the last week of break and start working on it and to make it easier on kids like myself I feel like the teachers should think of the ideas and just hand out papers stating exactly what they want and how they want it done.,Concluding Statement,794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971

A41214DF1DC5,708,2220,"This way, the teachers can give their students the right amount of prior exposure to the contents of the course before the school year starts. Many of my teachers this year used this tactic. Specifically, my chemistry teacher gave out a project that was due on the last day of the summer break. The project was to read about the history of the periodic table, how it was formed, and how elements and compounds are named; then, we had to answer some questions made by the teacher about what we had just learned. The motive behind giving students this assignment was so that the students would get acclimated to the elements and how to use them. This helped not only students but teachers as well. Teachers often spend many classes building a base of information on a certain topic before they begin the true course work. Summer assignments are a way that teachers can bypass this and save precious class time for the true coursework. An AP Calculus AB teacher in my school did that this year in their class for the first time. They assigned a project that made students use skills they learned in Math Analysis, the preceding course, and strengthened them for use in Calculus AB. This ensured that the students now had a good base of the necessary skills, students had prior knowledge, and she did not have to spend some extra classes reviewing those skills. The teachers were able to help all parties involved by designing a summer project for their students based on what the students would learn in the class.

This way the teachers received a final product that was enough to give students a satisfactory grade for their work. According to a scholarly article on the

New York Times

, students received a better grade, on average, on teacher designed work than an autonomous student designed projects. The article summarized a study that showed that students better grades of assignments that required them to reach a certain criteria than assignments that gave the full autonomy on the assignment. It can be predicted that this was the case because it is easier to grade for the teachers and create a project for the students when they know exactly what the teacher wants and expects.

Luke surved as a night watch man. He had to feed the animals every hour. So that way they did not have to starve. And cry all night for food and water to eat and drink.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive. But he couldnt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Luke also found time to have fun and he got to play volleyball, table tennis,boxing and fencing but this happend after they unloaded the animals then they got to have fun and enjoy their time.

Say someone who really didn't like working with other people, and only liked to do things by himself, joined the soccer team. When they would play practice games he would never pass to anyone, he kept the ball to himself, even when a few of his teammates were wide open, he never passed to them because he wanted to make the goal himself. However, every time he tried to make a goal alone, he always failed, and soon he learned that he would never make a goal by keeping the ball all to himself. He learned that in order to win, he must pass the ball and work with his teammates, passing the ball back and forth. He learned that the only way to win was through teamwork, had he not joined the soccer team, it would have taken him a while to learn that sometimes it's best to work with people, and joining that soccer team helped him build up his teamwork skills.

I chose to play the cello because I had heard people playing their cello's a while ago, but I remembered how beautiful it sounded. Also because I had seen a movie then about this girl who played the cello and she played beautiful pieces and wanted to play the cello as her career. It was an amazing movie and after watching it I could not get it out of my head. So that's when I decided i wanted play the cello. The first year playing the cello was pretty difficult because I did not know how to read the music and my teacher at my elemetry school was not really teaching me how to read the notes, but I was not really trying to either so that made it pretty difficult. The second year was a little better but still pretty bad because I still had not learned how to properly read the music. I had the same music teacher as last year and she still did not teach me how to read the notes or what they were called, but then again, just like last year, I was not really trying either. I would recognize some of the notes but still had no idea what they were called. So in those two years i basically learned how to play the cello, but not how to read what I played. Coming into middle school, I did not think I would continue to play the cello, considering my experience from the 2 years before, but I did choose to continue playing the cello going into middle school. That's where I met my new orchestra teachers and they taught me how to read the music. It took sometime but know I can read music sheets perfectly fine and I continued to play the cello into 8th grade as well. I tried something new, and the first 2 years were not the best, but towards the end, I ended loving to play the cello, even if Im not the best at it. Growing up kids find out what they enjoy and what they dislike, and that shapes how they see things and their personality. Including figuring what they want to do in the future, by figuring out what they enjoy doing, and avoiding the things they don't enjoy doing or being apart of, while having fun.

Almost everyone has a stand partner, unless someone has their own stand. You might need to talk to your stand partner and sometimes you become friends with them. Though it does not seem like it, you can make a lot of friends in orchestra, even if you play a different instrument or sit across the room from each other. There are times where we have to be serious, like preparing for a concert or during a concert, but before we can talk to each other, practice together, or just talk sometimes.

Another question I'd ask about this decision is ""how much money will it cost to buy snacks everyday for all the students being forced to go to clubs everyday?"" because the cost of the snacks everyday for a lot of students sounds like it isn't cheap. One last question I'd ask is would ""extracurricular activities count as a class?"" because if you missed the extracurricular activity, would you have to remake what you missed if you were absent like a class?

883D374AC02F,3625,4325,I agree with Making students do extracurricular activities. One reason why I think making kids do extracurricular activities would be a good Idea Is because they can develop new hobbies and make goals for themselves to achieve. Another reason why I think they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity is because they could find new activities that they enjoy and become successful in them. And the last reason why they should participate in an extra curricular activity is because they can develop better social skills and become a better person. Overall I think that students should be made to participate in an extracurricular activity because it can make you a better person.,Concluding Statement,648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762

GPS are installed to monitor where the car is in case of a crash or if the driver is lost on the road the driver can use it to find there destination. Motion sensors are being put into cars to help the driver drive safely. The motion sensors help the driver know how far away they are from hitting another car or even a person.

Google has already made a car that is ''driverless' and it has not crashed yet. These cars would run on a track that has an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.

Further on, they also explained some details they might add to the car. One of the details is that the car can handle functions up to twenty-five miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Not all of the cars are completely driverless. In fact, the only main things they can do are steer,accelerate, and brake. All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. Another detail they have is that the drivers seat vibrates when the vehicle is in dangerof backing into something. One last detail they mention is having cameras watch the driver to make sure that the drivers a remaining focused on the road.

BF195B6C980A,560,1584,"If all cars on the road are driverless, they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents, unlike with human drivers who can only control the car so well. The automated cars will be directly linked to brake systems, so if there is a need to brake, the car is hydroplanning, or another emergency is occuring, the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out by applying specific amounts of brake to each tire, as explained in section 5 of the story. Another safety measure taken with driverless cars is the ability for a human to take over.

It seems as it will cost more peopel more money and may even be more expensive repairs on with all the added technology to it as uses laser beams to form the car's surroundings. We are giving a car skills to mimic everything a human can do as we do. It was well still needs the driver's assitance to help out in case of any roadblocks or anything that the car cannot see. All i see with these cars is that we will continue to have more driving conflicts and if we get into an accident we have to come to mind to see whose fault was it the driver or the manufacturer. With all these new inventions of cars coming we are starting to have to build more laws into states to make sure we have the safety of everyone and everything. This invention could be a posssible great invention to be remembered or this invention could cause another issue in the world maybe because we all are not new to technological failures.

754CED955EFD,1132,3249," Richard A. Posner reason 1:

Certainty Of  Outcome

Dispute over  the out come is possible-it happend in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute between popular vote. the reson is that winnning candidate's share of electoral collage invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote.

reason 2

:

Everyone's President

The electoral college  requirs canadates to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional such as Mitt Romneywas in the south,has so innocently favored for he gain electoral vote by increasing his plurality in those states and if done he know he'll win.

reason 3

:

Swing States

The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces  the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Voters in toss up states are more likeley to pay close attention to the campeign to really listen to the competeing canidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likeley to be on the most thoughtful votes, on average(and futher reason they will have recived the most information and attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the one to decide the election.

reason 4

:

Big States

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmentof the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida [2012] never the less obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in woyming would net the winner got 3 electoral votes.

reason 5

:

Avoid Run-Off Elections

The electoral college avoids run-off elections wich no canindate recives a majority of the votes cast. For example , Nixion in 1968 and Clinton both had only 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure,wichwould greatly complicate the presidential election processes.

School allows for learning to occur at a place of convenience.

When students are sick or when they miss days, school has policies put in place to allow the students to cover and learn what they missed.

Learning from home may make matters worse and less convenient.

Students will start to put school further back on their priority list.

The home is a great place for a family but a terrible place for a student.

Learning from a home presents many difficulties that decrease convenience such as internet access, location, and the ability to get help.

She may complete the course and earn the credit but ultimately she would not absorb any of the information taught to her as she was overwhelmed by the busywork.

EF9D79A33BE7,1147,1542, My reasoning behind this is when your involved in something and your unsure on what to do asking a group of people would be your best choice.

My grandfather had no experience in Kathak, but he did play cricket. He advised me to continue dancing because dance kept me active and healthy, which was the same reason he played cricket. Even though they gave me the same advice, they both had different reasons because of their past experiences. Another cause of people having different perspectives is their age. I also asked for the advice of my younger sister Generic_Name. At the time Generic_Name was five years old. Generic_Name thought I should quit dance because she wanted me to be home more often so I could spend time with her. This was a very selfish, and childish answer, but this proves that age does affect perspective. My aunt and grandpa had a different perspectives than my sister because they are older.

For example, when I was younger I accidentally broke a necklace that my mother loved a lot. I was extremely worried that if I told her I would get in huge trouble, and I had no clue what to do. At first, I asked my older sister what to do, thinking she might have had a past experience with such an issue. She recommended to me that I should just hide the necklace, and pretend to not know where it was when asked by my mom. This seemed wrong to me, but I wasn't sure, so I sought other opinions. First, I asked some of my friends, and they instead recommended that I just tell the truth and tell her about how I accidentally broke her necklace. I wasn't sold yet on this opinion either, so I decided to ask one more person, my older brother. I then explained to him the situation, and he instantly reassured me on what my friends had said. He told me to tell her what had happened, and that she wouldn't be too mad as he knew that she could fix the necklace and would appreciate my honesty. In the end, it turned out my brother and my friends were correct. By doing what they said I avoided as much trouble as possible, and my mom got to have her necklace. By seeking multiple opinions I ended up with the safest and best answer possible. Seeking multiple opinions not only avoids bad or false statements, but it also avoids bias.

BF7DA06D503F,2362,3546,"Bias has become an increasingly strong issue in our country and in our people. Bias can be very detrimental to people who are seeking outside opinions on an issue, and may steer them down the wrong path. Someone with extreme bias on a topic may have clouded judgment on what the true facts and details on an issue are, making their opinion untrustworthy. Seeking multiple opinions, especially opinions from both sides of an issue are key in avoiding bias, as seeing both sides of the equation makes it easier to find a middle ground. For example, when people search to find the best presidential candidate, they will find extremely biased answers from both sides of the media. In order to find the best answer to the question of voting, voters must look at both sides, democratic and republican, to find the best answer for who should be the nominee. By simply viewing republican or democratic media, the voter will experience extreme bias and a sub par answer to the question of who really is best fit for the job. This is why getting multiple opinions and statements from both sides allows the voter to find the best answer for who will be the strongest candidate for the presidency",Evidence,443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650

Putting more heads together to think about ways to solve a problem has been proven to produce the strongest answers possible. This proof can be shown in a 2016 study done by Dr. Williams of Harold-Webster University. Some things listed in the study showed that groups found better and more sustainable answers to problems that they were given than people who were working with only one other person on the same topic. The numbers were staggering, as the groups of people had a 95.7% success rate in finding the best possible solution, while the people working with only one other person only had a 60% success rate in finding the best solution to the same issue. The study concluded that groups of people were way more efficient and successful than the other people who worked on the same topic with a partner. The study went as far as to recommend the practice of getting others opinions and working in groups to it's readers. This clear benefit in getting advise from multiple people to solve problems has inspired top scientists to collaborate with others on their work. Even the president must find outside opinions, such as when he consults his advisers or when he calls a special session of congress to talk things over. This clear benefit of multiple opinions is what the very principle of democracy was founded on, and makes up our United States politics and ideals today.

Your one friend that you asked could be prejudice against your other friend, and give you a false, or bias, opinion.

Instead, these astronomers pushed through the cries of heresy to find the truth. They were skeptics. Speculation and skepticism breed creativity and the need for truth, two essential facets of human existance. You may think that this is getting a bit off-topic, but it actually mirrors the topic at hand. We must be skeptical of others advice, for taking bad advice can be extremely detrimental. And what better way to find the truth than to find a collection of them, and pull from that the correct thing to do? A person should get advice from different people, because it plays to the natural human trait of skepticism, which has long been found to be the pathway to truth. But this isnt the only reason one should gather the advice of more than one person.

The guide took them about halfway through this 'route', and then informed them that he would have to head back, as he had more groups to take. Shortly thereafter, the trail became much harder. They had to abandon their horse and wagon, and eventually, winter caught up with them. Stuck in a cabin they had found, with no food or water, the family perished.
